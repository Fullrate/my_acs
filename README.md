Example of how to use acs_ex

## Description ##

Just a silly example that shows how to setup an acs_ex supervisor
and how to use the session_start method to do something.

From there one can imagine how the example could be expanded to
incorporate the logic needed to for instance automatically provision
new devices, upgrade firmwares, and so on...
